* Minha.pt: middleware testing platform *


1. Overview
-----------

The Minha platform virtualizes multiple JVM instances within a single
JVM while simulating key environment components, thus reproducing the
concurrency, distribution, and performance characteristics of the
actual system.

Implementation is based on Java and takes advantage of bytecode
transformation to automatically convert application code to simulation
environment.
